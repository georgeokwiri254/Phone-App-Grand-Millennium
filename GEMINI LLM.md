# front end

Include a chat input box where the user can type questions about arrivals, revenue, deposits, rates, etc.

Display conversation messages in a chat format, alternating between user messages and AI responses.

Show a loading indicator while processing each user message.

For each user question, the app should call a backend function that generates SQL via Gemini and fetches the results.

Display both the generated SQL query and the query results (table or summary) in the chat.

Include error handling for empty input or failed queries.

Keep the layout clean, scrollable, and wide enough for tables and messages.

Optional: Allow the chat to persist session messages during the user’s session.
Add a text input box where the user can type a natural language question about arrivals or revenue data.

Add a button labeled “Ask”.

When the button is clicked, show a loading spinner while processing.

Display the generated SQL query (as plain text) and the query results (in a table/dataframe).

Make the layout clean and wide, with enough space for tables.

Add basic error handling (e.g., if no question is typed, show a warning).
enerate a Python backend module for a Streamlit Revenue Analysis App that does the following:
# back end#
Connects to an SQLite database called revenue_data.db.

Defines a function to run SQL queries safely and return results as a Pandas DataFrame.

Configures the Gemini API with an API key from an environment variable.

Defines a function that takes a natural language question, sends it to Gemini with the database schema, and receives a SQL SELECT query.

The backend must only allow SELECT queries; prevent DELETE, UPDATE, DROP, or INSERT commands.

Handles exceptions and returns error messages if SQL fails.

Returns both the generated SQL and the query results in a format that can be displayed by Streamlit.

Include comments explaining each function and usage instructions for connecting to the frontend.

Make the code modular so the frontend can call functions like generate_sql(question) and query_db(sql_query).
